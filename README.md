# AndroidStudioProject

This is an android project with all of the files in a zipped folder. You may read the code (XML and JAVA) in Android Studio as well as test 
the app in an AS emulator. If you would just like to see the final product (need the apk) please email me at amanda.marie.p AT 
gmail DOT com 

This app allows users to access search engines I have custom made to search particular shopping sites (multiple variations).
